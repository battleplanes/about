A Gameplay in images
====================

Planes can be placed anywhere on the grid, as long as they fit completely into
the grid:

Planes can also be rotated:

Once a plane has been positioned and rotated as desired, it can be sent to
mission:

When all planes have been sent to mission, the players start bombarding each
other in turns:

On the left hand-side is the player's own board, and on the right hand-side are
the results of his hits. Here we can see a *miss* at `A1` and a *hit* at `E2`:

Kills are aditionally marked in red, as it is here the case with `H7`. Note
that once killed, the tiles the plane used to occupy now count as *miss*, as it
is here the case with `H6`, `F7`, `I7`, `H8`:

Here we can see how a plane starts to take shape. Its head will most probably
be at `F3`, oriented towards east:

And indeed, after we aim at that tile, we get a *kill*:

Note again how `E2` and `E4` which we hit after killing the plane now count as
*misses*:
