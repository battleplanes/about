What is this?
=============

Battleplanes is a game similar with battleships, but more challenging.

The Battleplanes Project
========================

The purpose of the battleplanes project is to serve as:

* a playground for learning new languages and technology stacks
* a template for other projects
* evaluating programming languages and technology stacks

It was chosen because the game is simple enough to be programmed in a short
timespan by an experienced programmer, and in a manageable time by novice
programmers under guidance.

At the same time, the game poses some interesting challenges both in terms of
algorithms, as well as software design and using the ecosystem around an
existing technology stack.

There are various implementations of battleplanes, in different programming
languages, using different frameworks and libraries.

This `about` project serves as a coordination hub among all other projects,
making sure that they all implement the same game, and keeping track of common
issues across all implementations.
